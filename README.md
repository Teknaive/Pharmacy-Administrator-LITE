Official repository of one of my first Java projects, this is Pharmacy Administrator LITE

## Prerequisites
Before running the application, make sure you have:
- Java Runtime Environment (JRE) installed on your computer
  - To check if Java is installed, open a terminal/command prompt and type: `java -version`
  - If Java is not installed, download and install it from the official [Java website](https://www.java.com/es/download/manual.jsp)

## Installation
1. Download the `.jar` file, located at: `Pharmacy Administrator LITE/dist/` in this repository.
2. Save it to a location on your computer where you have read and write permissions

## Running the Application

### Method 1: Double-click (Graphical Interface)
1. Navigate to the folder where you saved the `.jar` file
2. Double-click the file named `filename.jar`
   - If this doesn't work, proceed to Method 2 or Method 3

### Method 2: Command Line (Windows)
1. Open Command Prompt (cmd)
   - Press `Windows + R`
   - Type `cmd` and press Enter
2. Navigate to the folder containing the `.jar` file:
   ```sh
   cd path\to\your\jar\file
   ```
3. Run the application:
   ```sh
   java -jar filename.jar
   ```
   - Replace `filename.jar` with the actual name of the file

### Method 3: Terminal (macOS/Linux)
1. Open Terminal
2. Navigate to the folder containing the `.jar` file:
   ```sh
   cd path/to/your/jar/file
   ```
3. Run the application:
   ```sh
   java -jar filename.jar
   ```
   - Replace `filename.jar` with the actual name of the file

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues:

1. Verify Java installation:
   ```sh
   java -version
   ```
   - If this command fails, reinstall Java

2. Check file permissions:
   - Windows: Right-click the `.jar` file → Properties → Make sure it's not blocked
   - Linux/macOS: Make the file executable:
     ```sh
     chmod +x filename.jar
     ```

3. Try running with console output:
   ```sh
   java -jar filename.jar -console
   ```
   This will show any error messages that might help identify the problem.

## About the Application

This desktop application, developed using the Java programming language, serves as a tool to assist in the management of pharmacies. It showcases my current programming skills as of July 15, 2024. The application was created with dedication and love to demonstrate my capabilities up to this point.

### Key Features

- **Pharmacy Management:** The application provides basic functionalities to help manage various aspects of a pharmacy.
- **Data Structures:** The application utilizes Maps and ArrayLists for efficient data handling and storage within the program.

### Current Limitations

At present, the application does not include a MySQL database for persistent data storage. Consequently, all data entered during a session will be lost once the application is closed, reverting to its initial state upon the next launch. This limitation highlights the need for future integration of a database to ensure data persistence.

### Purpose

The primary objective of this application is to exhibit my proficiency in Java programming and my ability to implement essential features using core data structures. While the application serves a practical purpose, it is also a testament to my learning journey and the skills I have developed so far.

I hope this project demonstrates my passion for software development and my commitment to continuous improvement in the field.
